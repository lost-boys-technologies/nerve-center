# RBS Fantasy Football Nerve Center

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Currently a Work in Progress

Initially, this will serve as a landing page for members of my fantasy football league. Additional features I would like to include are as follows:

-   League member info
-   League Constitution (rules)
-   Other league rules
-   League Bets
-   League Achievements
-   League member stats
-   And much, much more

It will most likely be refactored to use more modern technologies (Next.js/Astro and potentially Tailwind) and will include an updated version of this [ "Draft Day" feature](https://github.com/kenhoward/benched-sports-dos).

## Installation

For this to function in its entirety, you will need the firebase `config.js` file at the root.

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lost-boys-technologies/nerve-center.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory
```
cd nerve-center
```

3. Use the correct Node.js version
```
nvm use
```

4. Install dependencies
```
npm install  # Use 'sudo npm install' if necessary
```

5. Start the development server
```
npm start
```
